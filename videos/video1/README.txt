to HTTP GET requests at the root URL ('/'). When the route is accessed,
the application returns a simple string message of 'Hello, World!'. ##

##The code begins by importing the Flask class from the Flask module, 
and then creating a Flask object called 'app'. 
The '@app.route' decorator is then used to define a route for the root URL. 
The 'index' function is associated with the route, and is called whenever the route is accessed. 
The function simply returns the 'Hello, World!' message as a response.##

##Finally, the 'name' variable is checked to ensure that the script is being run directly,
and then the 'app.run()' method is called to start the Flask development server.##

Overall, this code provides a basic introduction to the Flask framework and demonstrates how to create a simple web application using Flask in Python.
