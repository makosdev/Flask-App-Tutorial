

##  This is a basic Flask application that includes two HTML files, 
index.html and second-page.html, and defines routes for both of them.
 When the application is run, navigating to the root URL (/) will display the index.html file, 
while navigating to the /second URL will display the second-page.html file.  ##

## The HTML files have been customized with CSS styles and centered on the page. Additionally, 
buttons have been added to each page for navigation between the two pages. ## 

##Installation and Usage##

##To run this application, first install Flask by running pip install flask in your terminal. 
Then, save the app.py file and both HTML files in the same directory.##

## Next, navigate to the directory in your terminal and run the command python app.py to start the Flask development server. 
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view the index.html page. Click the "Go to Second Page" 
button to navigate to the second-page.html page, and click the "Go Back to Index" button to return to the index.html page. ##
